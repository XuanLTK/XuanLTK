## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## ðŸ˜Š Something about me 

With a Biotechnology background, I have experience in product development at **FPT Telecom**, focusing on customer needs and user experience. Additionally, I have experience in genetic reporting at **DNA Medical Technology.**  

I have a strong interest in leveraging data to drive insights and a desire to apply my analytical skills and innovative thinking in technology and healthcare. This has prompted my transition to a **Data Analyst** role, supported by training from the **UniGap Data Analytics Coaching Program.**  

I am always eager to learn and engage in exciting projects where I can contribute my analytical skills and creativity.
